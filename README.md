## About
QuestMart is a marketplace platform that transforms the shopping experience by incorporating elements from the geek world. The idea is to bring an innovative approach to e-commerce, where users can explore, unlock rewards, and interact dynamically.

## Concept
The concept was designed to create a more engaging and immersive shopping experience, inspired by gamification mechanics. QuestMart allows users to progress, earn XP, and access exclusive discounts while navigating a modern and intuitive interface.

## Recommendations
The platform is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on all devices. However, as new features are being developed, some functionalities are still in progress.

## Challenges
The project was developed using React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS. The main goal was to create a high-performance, responsive, and visually appealing platform. Future updates will include a login system, personalized accounts, and enhanced gamification mechanics.

## About the Code
It may seem simple, but the core functionality involves a home page where, after completing the Captcha and selecting "Start" on the Virtual Keyboard, the system shuffles and selects 10 questions from the chosen category. This process is handled using useEffect, ensuring randomness while allowing users to navigate between questions seamlessly.
