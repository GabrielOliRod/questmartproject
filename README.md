## About
QuestMart is a website where you can find the best interactive quizzes!
Here, users can test their knowledge on various topics, exploring engaging challenges.

## Concept
The idea behind QuestMart came from the need to create a dynamic and accessible quiz platform. Inspired by different interactive experiences, the project aims to provide a fun and educational environment for users.

##Recommendations
Due to time constraints during development, I couldn't make the website fully responsive for mobile devices. As a result, it works best on computers.

##Challenges
One of my biggest challenges was bug fixing, as I had to deal with many new concepts. From using useEffect for major tasks to implementing Drag and Hold (my favorite mechanic), every step was a learning experience.

##About the Code
It may seem simple, but the core functionality involves a home page where, after completing the Captcha and selecting "Start" on the Virtual Keyboard, the system shuffles and selects 10 questions from the chosen category. This process is handled using useEffect, ensuring randomness while allowing users to navigate between questions seamlessly.
